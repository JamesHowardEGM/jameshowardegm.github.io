Welcome to my cyber lab. I’m James Howard — currently studying a Bachelor of Cybersecurity and building offensive security skills through hands-on labs, scripting, and practical exploitation.

I’m active on TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and building red team tools under my personal brand: **EGM – Exceptionally Gifted Machines**.
